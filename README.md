# Blink-Based Liveness Detection System

This project implements a simple **liveness detection system** using **blink detection** and **head orientation prompts** (left/right turns) with OpenCV, dlib, and Haar cascade classifiers.

The system ensures a real user is present by instructing them to **turn their head left and right and blink**, using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect blinks. It's useful in basic anti-spoofing systems for facial recognition.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Detects faces using **Haar cascades** (frontal and profile).
- Uses **dlib's 68-point face landmark predictor** to locate the eyes.
- Calculates **EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)** to detect blinks.
- Instructs the user to:
  1. Turn left and blink.
  2. Turn right and blink.
- Confirms liveness if at least one blink is detected in each instruction.

## 📦 Requirements

Install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib imutils scipy numpy
````

Make sure the following files are available in the `dataset/` folder:

* `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
* `haarcascade_profileface.xml`
* `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`
  *(Download from: [http://dlib.net/files/shape\_predictor\_68\_face\_landmarks.dat.bz2](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2))*

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python liveness_detection.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions:

1. Turn your head left and blink.
2. Turn your head right and blink.

If blinks are detected correctly, you’ll see:

```
Liveness Successful!
```

## ⚠️ Notes

* Works best in well-lit environments.
* Face must be visible (not heavily occluded).
* EAR threshold may need tuning for different lighting or camera conditions.
